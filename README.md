<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Download or fork this repo, make sure to run gradle build in Java IDE, then inside the book-shelf-app folder, type "npm install"
to install all necessary dependencies.</p>
<p>Make sure you've installed docker and docker-compose CLI</p>
<h3>Spin Up</h3>
<p>Since I integrated both my back-end and front-end by using docker, and created a docker-compose file. You can run this
by tying "docker-compose up" inside the root folder, and all components will spin up automatically.</p>
<p>When the system has spined up, go to "http://localhost:3000" to play with this app</p>
